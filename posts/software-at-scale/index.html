<p>Lately I have been working with a huge project that spans multiple continents,
keeps over couple of hundred software professionals busy and is actually managed
by agile practices. Keeping this kind of a project up and running and steering
it to the right direction is not an easy feat so I thought that sharing some
lessons learned could benefit other fellow practitioners.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll write about three main points that are crucial for the success of a large
scale software project:</p>

<ul>
<li>organisation</li>
<li>leadership</li>
<li>people.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="oiling-the-machine">Oiling the machine</h2>

<p>With growing number of people in a project organisation comes also a challenge.
Organising work of a team can be easy but doing that for ten or more teams is
not. There are some traditional approaches to solve this, but I personally have
seen better results with empowering individual teams to make their own
decisions.</p>

<p>Yeah, let&rsquo;s add more middle management! Image by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@spiritvisionstudios">Ben
Rosett</a>.</p>

<p>Traditional way of responding to the growth of an organisation is to add more
middle management, layers to the organisation that ease the burden of top
management. But is the &ldquo;more of the same&rdquo; approach with management really the
best option to structure the organisation and culture around it?</p>

<p>Management layers tend to make decision making slower and add overhead to the
processes. So instead of adding costs and slowness to the organisation, what
about rethinking the way of working to make organisation scale smoother?</p>

<p>With large projects uncertainty is the norm. There are so many moving parts that
it is impossible to manage them all efficiently centrally. Agile practices
approach this by empowering teams with fast feedback loop, short and incremental
development iterations and freedom and responsibility to deliver value. With the
help of cultural changes like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps">DevOps</a>, it
is easier to build lightweight and self-driven teams that can respond to the
diverse challenges of a complex system.</p>

<p>There are also some frameworks like <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/domain-driven-design-services-architecture">Domain driven
design</a>
that can help with defining building blocks of a system and responsibilities for
individual teams.</p>

<h2 id="direction-steering">Direction &amp; steering</h2>

<p>While structuring an organisation for optimal performance can provide fast time
to market for new features/changes/fixes, there is also a different dimension to
consider that can make or break a complex solution.</p>

<p>Leadership, be it technical or for people, is crucial for any bigger unit of
work. There needs to be a clear direction and common goal that every team
pursues. Without shared understanding and governance development efforts can
side-track and derail the project.</p>

<p>Leadership is the tool for setting a vision and steering teams towards it. The
essence of this is more about effective communication and collaboration than
actual &ldquo;management&rdquo;.</p>

<h2 id="happy-people">Happy people</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Happy developers produce better code</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Too often focus on project management is in technical aspect like schedules or
sprint contents. It is important to understand that its the people that make a
project. Understanding the motivations of others and enabling them to grow
professionally and succeed is the way to also make a project successful.</p>

<p>People make things happen.</p>
